  Specific functioning of gbpublisher: capabilities, limitations, real workflows and troubleshooting.
---

This section focuses specifically on gbpublisher as a concrete tool for implementing the concepts and methodologies described in previous levels. Here we document what the tool does and what it does not do, establishing realistic and clear expectations. We describe real workflows as they happen in daily practice, not theoretical idealizations. And we address the most common error cases that editorial teams face, providing concrete strategies to resolve them.

The content of this level is oriented to users who will work directly with gbpublisher in editorial production.
